# **A look at Otherside resource price manipulation risks from Otherdeed NFTs currently for sale**
## Using StreamLit (Python interactive data apps) I wanted to build an app that would look into the future potential issues that the NFT based Otherside MMORPG game from Yuga Labs could face from price manipulation.
## Web3 allows for levels of coordination of funds and efforts not seen in web2, which already has price in-game resource/item price manipulations frequently. 
## By looking at what percentage of certain resource could be currently purchased we can start to see how much it would cost and the availability to start to corner the market for a certain resource.
